#FlashCard
=========

FlashCard is an iOS app written in Objective-C. It's a practice project of mine to get some more experience with iOS Development. 

### The app

The app is a single view app. Its purpose is to answer questions about which city belongs to its federal state or vice versa. Not a big deal ... ;)
